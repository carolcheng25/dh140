Hi! My name is Carol and in this course (Digital Humanities 140), we will be learning how to code with python and apply this knowledge into the humanities. Some ideas I have are looking into which songs are the most popular and the words that show up the most to get an idea of what kind of songs people like best, or anything criminology/food insecurity although I'm not quite sure how I would go about those quite yet. My learning outcomes for this class are to become proficient in Python, being able to apply Python to critically describe, anazlyze, and vizualize data in the context of humaniteis, and gain expertise in coding and data science research.
